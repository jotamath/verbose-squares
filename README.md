# Radius + Squares
### Disco effect + Random Squares
Just made a few tests mixing both of [Disco Effect](https://github.com/jotamath/verbose-disco) and [Squares](https://github.com/jotamath/randomsquares) to see how it would behave (if it would destroy each other, what would it do)

>I was very fascinated and wanted to test if I could utilize JS loops to create random autogenerate art for a website, for instance.
For this purpose, I used Git and Node.js, also Canvas Sketch and Canvas Sketch Util:

- [Canvas Sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/)
- [Canvas Sketch Util](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util) - To use math functions easily

>So after I tested and changed some colors, I saved all the photos I've made (just hitting Ctrl (or Cmd) + S ) and putted them into a video editing app. That was the result:
